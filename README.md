Run

```
$ julia --project double_pendulum_logo.jl
```

to produce the logo above or 

```
$ julia --project double_pendulum.jl
```

to produce a series of animations demonstrating the normal modes of the double pendulum withouth forcing nor dissipation and how we can excite these normal modes in the presence of forcing and dissipation.
